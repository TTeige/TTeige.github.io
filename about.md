## The blog
This blog is about everything and nothing. A place to collect my thoughts and reflect about what I might have learned from work, 
from working on hobby projects or from learning for the sake of learning. Personal subjects will might not be shared, but
who knows what might happen in a distant future. 

## I, me and myself
A blog by me! Tim Alexander Teige. I am a software developer for [NAV-IKT](https://github.com/navikt), a Norwegian government institution 
which tries to ensure that citizens receive social security and support when in times of need.

I recently joined NAV in November 2018 after completing a Master of Computer Science degree from the Arctic University of Norway.

While studying I worked for the Chemistry department on [META-pipe](https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/) a genome analytic tool.

I also worked the History department using machine learning models to analyze census records from 1950 to extract handwritten numbers and
text from the structured documents.
