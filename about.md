A blog by me! Tim Alexander Teige. I am a software developer for [NAV-IKT](https://github.com/navikt), a Norwegian government institution 
which tries to ensure that citizens receive social security and support when in times of need.

I recently joined NAV in November 2018 after completing a Master of Computer Science degree from the Arctic University of Norway.

While studying I worked for the Chemistry department on [META-pipe](https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/) a genome analytic tool.


I also worked the History department using machine learning models to analyze census records from 1950 to extract handwritten numbers and
text from the structured documents.
